# Welcome! 
I am currently a PhD student at Southern University of Science and Technology, [MAE](https://mae.sustech.edu.cn/), [Institue for Manufacturing Innovation](https://imi.sustech.edu.cn/) with an expected graduation date of July 2025.

From 2021 to 2024, I specialized in Mechanics under the supervision of Professor [Liangchi Zhang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhangliangchi.html), focusing on interface contact in thermal molding for glass. Prior to this, from 2014 to 2021, I completed both my Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degrees in Materials Engineering at [Nanchang University](https://english.ncu.edu.cn/), where I conducted research on magnesium alloy under the supervision of Professor [Yong Liu](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57580549700).

My research interests encompass Materials science, Interface adhesion mechanics, Molecular dynamics simulations, and First-principles calculations. Currently, I am actively engaged in projects related to optical lenses for my doctoral research.

You can find my CV here: [Hanhan Zhao‚Äôs Curriculum Vitae](../assets/cv_Hanhanzhao.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:12131127@mail.sustech.edu.cn).
